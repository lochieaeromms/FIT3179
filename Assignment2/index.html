                 With many long term projects committed to, public funds are subsequently tied up. When the Covid-19 pandemic occured, it required
                 large amounts of public funding to sustain the health and economy of Victoria, driving public debt up as funds can't be reallocated
                 from infrastructure projects that are already underway.

                Throughout the budget years analysed, the <span class = "Transport"> Transport</span> sector is consistently 
                the highest proportion of the Major Project spending. The low investment in <span class="Justice"> Justice and Emergency Services</span> is also prevalent, with there being only 3 <b>major</b>
                projects. This is indicative of the lower cost for many of the projects that are funded, not meeting the > $100 million cutoff.

                The probability density above shows the distribution of each project's cost over the budget years. Most projects cost less than
                the $500 million. Nearly all projects under the <span class="Culture"> Culture, Sport and Community</span> in the 2019-20 and 2023-24 years 
                cost ~$100 million, with the largest outlier being the<span class="Culture"> Melbourne Arts Precinct redevelopment</span> costing ~$1.5 billion.
                The larger investment in the <span class="Health">Health and Human Services</span> is prevalent with a much flatter distribution stretching to the $3 billion mark for the redevelopment

                The distribution between Regional to Metropolitan spending is an interesting way of investigating whether spending is related to population.
                78.1% of Victorians live in the designated Metropolitan area of Melbourne, but this is not represented in the investment seen above. The toal rate for <span class="Culture">all sectors</span> 
                is only 5.98% in 23-24 maxing out at 12.5% in 19-20 before Covid-19. This is still well below the 21.9% that would accurately represent the regional population. The <span class="grey">Health and Human services</span> sector most closely 
                follows the regional distribution.

                The cost-weighted investment center shows the geogaphic location of investment. As seen in the regional investment plot, the geographic center is close to the center of Melbourne,

                A common idea amongst the general public is that infrastructure projects regularly are delivered over-budget and late. 
                Looking at all the projects that have been completed since being added to the State Capital Program, we can see there is actually a 
                50%-50% split on projects that were <span class="Health">finished late</span> to those that were <span class=Culture> delivered early</span>.
                Of the 12 late projects, 7 belong to the <b>Transport</b> sector, these projects will no doubt be joined by the Metro Tunnel and West Gate Tunnel that are already late to their initial 
                completion dates.
