                            wasted a day delivering the services and
                            projects that matter to Victorians.
                            Health systems around the world were hit hard
                            by the pandemic, and ours was no different.
                            But we’ve invested in our hospitals – and the
                            dedicated workers we need to run them – so
                            Victorians can get the very best care.
                            Cranes dominate our skyline. Underground,
                            we’re just as busy, building the transport
                            network of the future.
                            We’re building, fixing and widening our
                            suburban and regional roads to cut congestion
                            and get Victorians home to their families
                            sooner and safer.
                            We've put power back in the hands of
                            Victorians with the popular $250 Power Saving
                            Bonus. It's helping households across the state
                            get the best deal on their energy bills, while
                            providing the cost of living relief Victorians
                            need right now.
                            We’re giving Victorian kids the best start in life –
                            we’ve invested in hundreds of school upgrades
                            across Victoria to deliver high‑quality classrooms
                            and facilities to make sure every student gets the
                            world-class education they deserve.
                            From Wangaratta to Warrnambool, we’re
                            building the road and rail, schools and
                            hospitals that country communities deserve.
                            And when our regions have faced the toughest
                            of times – from bushfires to floods – we’ve been
                            there to help</p></div>

        <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Last year, we took a positive plan to the
            Victorian people.
            It was a plan for better hospitals, world‑class
            schools, and the road and rail our growing
            state needs.
            It was a plan for cleaner, cheaper renewable
            energy, a plan for the very best start in life for
            our kids, and a plan to help Victorians with the
            rising cost of living.
            And with this Budget, we're delivering every
            commitment we made at the last election,
            all while repaying the COVID debt.
            It was a plan to keep doing what matters.
            This includes:
            » $1 billion to bring back the State Electricity
            Commission (SEC), re‑establishing
            government‑owned energy and investing in
            renewables
            » $694 million for a road blitz to upgrade key
            roads and intersections to improve network
            efficiency, travel times and road safety
            » $650 million to upgrade the Melton Line,
            giving commuters in Melbourne’s West
            better train services
            » $601 million to buy 23 more VLocity trains
            to be manufactured in Victoria, supporting
            local jobs
            » $450 million to support the delivery of new
            and upgraded low‑fee Independent and
            Catholic schools
            » $400 million to deliver another round of the
            $250 Power Saving Bonus, driving down the
            cost of energy bills for Victorian households
            » $320 million to plan the delivery of major
            investments at seven hospitals across
            the state to ensure Victorians receive the
            highest quality healthcare
            » $266 million to upgrade 43 government
            schools across Victoria, giving our kids
            the high‑quality classrooms and learning
            facilities they deserve</p></div>

    <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>In Victoria, our health system has been
            stretched like never before. Increases in
            patients with COVID‑19 are just one part of
            the picture: the pandemic also disrupted
            care, slowed down recovery times, and saw
            people putting off visits to their GP. All of this
            has put huge demand on our hospitals and
            healthcare professionals.
            We’ve worked hard to ease that unprecedented
            pressure on the system. Last year, we launched
            our Pandemic Repair Plan for more staff, better
            hospitals and first‑class care.
            This is included in the $54 billion we’ve invested
            in our healthcare system – as well as the
            workers we need to run it – since coming to
            government in 2014.
            We’ll keep investing in health, so Victorians can
            get the very best of care – where and when
            they need it. This Budget provides a further
            $4.9 billion to build and upgrade hospitals,
            boost healthcare services and give our
            healthcare workforce the support they need</p></div>

        <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>The Victorian economy is strong and it’s growing.
            Today, demand for workers is high, and there are
            close to a record number of Victorians in work.
            The unemployment rate is below 4 per cent as it
            has been for most of the past year – which hasn’t
            happened for nearly 50 years.
            Across the world, countries are grappling with
            high inflation and interest rate hikes – and
            Australia is no different. But Victoria’s economy
            will weather these challenges from a position
            of strength.
            In 2021-22, Victoria’s real gross state product
            growth was the highest of any Australian
            state. And it’s expected to remain solid this
            financial year.
            It’s this healthy economy – alongside everything
            Victoria has to offer – that’s again attracting
            large numbers of people to our state, with our
            population growing by 300 people every day.
            Out of a total $21.2 billion spent on
            economic‑related measures, more than
            $14 billion in support was provided to help
            businesses and the economy survive and
            recover. Crucially, these measures ensured the
            Victorian economy could bounce back once
            the worst of the pandemic was over.
            Other important investments were made to
            ensure our households and communities were
            supported and strengthened</p></div>
